## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository setup: design and configuration documents, contribution process, CI.
- `splicefs --version`.
- Client (`splicefs`): `mount`, `umount` and `status`; several clusters and mounts in one
  configuration; merged directory tree; block reads from every node holding an identical
  copy, with per-node speed tracking and re-request of late blocks; on-disk block cache
  with size, age and free-space limits and revalidation; reading of completely cached
  files while no node can be reached; systemd readiness notification.
- Mount layers: FUSE on Linux, a local NFS server with the built-in NFS client on macOS.
- `core`, the client as an importable library (`github.com/SpliceFS/client/core`).
- A systemd unit for the program.
